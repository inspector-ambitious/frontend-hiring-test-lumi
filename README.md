Hi there,

# Introduction

This is a short coding test where we'd like you to make a set of tests pass.

The tests are already written and you shouldn't need to modify them, just 
implement the functions they call. 

You're welcome to use any solution you like, including code from google 
searches/stack overflow/etc, but you should be able to explain how it works.

# Running the tests

Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser and the test runner will run 
automatically, showing you which tests passed and failed, where failing tests 
will give you information on why it failed.

To start with they'll all fail, and we'd like you to make them pass one at a
time by editing `main.js` and implementing each function. 

You might want to look in `index.html` to see the DOM structure used in some
of the tests. You can look in `tests.js` to how the tests are built and what
they expect.

You can ignore anything in `qunit/`, those are the assets for the test runner.
